# Mergin Server

Mergin is a web platform for storage and synchronisation of geospatial projects across multiple users and devices (desktop and mobile).The platform is especially useful when you need: 

- **Mobile data collection**. If you need to capture location of assets (and their attributes) or update an existing database.

- **Data sharing**. No complicated setup of access by IT admins to get your data to colleagues or clients. Set up permissions and send invites with few clicks.

- **Offline access**. Work with data with no interruption even without constant Internet connection - sync any changes when you are back online.

- **Collaborative editing**. No more problems dealing with multiple copies of the same dataset in different versions - all changes are automatically consolidated in one place.

- **Audit changes**. Knowing who has changed what and when in a database is often important - Mergin keeps track of the history and allows to go back if needed.

- **No coding required**. Everything can be set up with no knowledge of programming.
